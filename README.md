# Contacts-Management
A Web app built mainly on .Net6 using razor pages, used to managing your contacts.

This is a personal project that I created during the time I still went to FPT University.

The project is fully function likes google contacts, The architecture of this project is well built by myself or at least I think so :D. You can add, delete, update your contacts, the number is formatted thanks to the library I added on visual studio. You can export or import your contacts in the excel forms, you can export the data first to see how to excel form looks like, the default export location is in the wwwRoot folder.

Hope you find this project helpful!
